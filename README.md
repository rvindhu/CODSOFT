Overview : 
This repository includes three foundational machine learning projects designed to help you develop and hone your data science skills. Each project involves building predictive models using well-known datasets and applying a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Tasks

1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective:
Leverage the Titanic dataset to create a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic. This dataset contains information such as the passenger's age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
Details:
This is a classic beginner project that introduces you to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification modeling. You will explore how different factors like socioeconomic status, age, and gender influenced the survival chances of passengers. The goal is to build an accurate classifier that can predict the survival outcome of a passenger based on these attributes.
Techniques:
Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Classification Modeling

2. Iris Flower Classification
Objective:
Train a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project uses the famous Iris dataset, which is a staple in the machine learning community for introductory classification tasks.
Details:
This project will guide you through the process of building a simple yet effective classification model. You will learn how to preprocess the data, handle potential issues such as missing values, and select appropriate features for model training. The end goal is to accurately classify new Iris flower samples based on their physical measurements.
Techniques:
Data Preprocessing
Classification Modeling.

3. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Objective:
Develop a predictive model that estimates movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, cast, and other relevant attributes. The primary goal is to analyze historical movie data and build a regression model that accurately predicts the rating a movie might receive from users or critics.
Details:
This project is designed to deepen your understanding of data analysis and regression techniques. By examining how different features affect movie ratings, you will gain insights into what factors are most influential in determining the success or failure of a film. The project also provides a hands-on experience with feature engineering and data preprocessing, which are crucial steps in building robust machine learning models.
Techniques:
Data Analysis
Regression Modeling
Feature Engineering
